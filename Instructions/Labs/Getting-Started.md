# MS Fabric Foundation for Enterprise Analytics

### Overall Estimated Duration: 8 Hours

## Overview

In this hands-on lab, you will work with **Microsoft Fabric** to build a complete, cloud-scale analytics solution for managing and analyzing large volumes of e-commerce transaction data. You will create data pipelines to continuously ingest transactional information, store it in a scalable data warehouse, and run real-time analytics to monitor live data streams for instant insights. You will also leverage **Apache Spark** for complex analysis and machine learning, use **Dataflows Gen2** to clean and transform data, and explore the dataset interactively with notebooks.

By the end of this lab, you will have practical experience in setting up an integrated data environment that enables real-time, data-driven decision-making and helps optimize business strategies effectively.

## Objective

1. **Ingest data with a pipeline in Microsoft Fabric:** Use data pipelines to import and prepare data for analysis within Microsoft Fabric. Participants will automate the import and preparation of data for subsequent analysis.

1. **Analyze data in a data warehouse:** Perform complex queries and insights on large datasets stored in a data warehouse within Microsoft Fabric. Participants will execute complex queries to derive insights from large datasets.

1. **Get started with Real-Time Analytics in Microsoft Fabric:** Implement real-time data processing and analytics to gain immediate insights from live data streams. Participants will enable immediate insights and decision-making from live data streams.

1. **Use notebooks to train a model in Microsoft Fabric:** Utilize interactive notebooks for developing, training, and testing machine learning models within Microsoft Fabric. Participants will develop and refine machine learning models interactively.

1. **Analyze data with Apache Spark:** Leverage Apache Spark’s distributed computing capabilities to perform large-scale data analysis in Microsoft Fabric. Participants will perform scalable, high-performance data analysis on large volumes of data.

1. **Create a Dataflow (Gen2) in Microsoft Fabric:** Design and implement advanced data transformation workflows using Dataflow Gen2 for enhanced data integration and processing. Participants will design and execute sophisticated data transformation processes for integration and processing.

## Prerequisites

Participants should have:

- Knowledge of data integration principles and experience with data formats and sources.
- Understanding of SQL and relational database concepts, and familiarity with data warehousing solutions.
- Familiarity with machine learning concepts and experience with programming languages like Python or R
- Understanding of distributed computing principles and experience with data processing frameworks like Apache Spark.

## Architecture

Microsoft Fabric offers a comprehensive suite of services to manage and analyze data at scale. Participants can set up a central workspace for project management, automate data ingestion with pipelines, and perform complex queries using its data warehouse capabilities. Real-time data processing is supported through a dedicated analytics engine, while interactive notebooks facilitate machine learning model development. Apache Spark provides scalable data processing, and advanced data transformations are handled by Dataflow Gen2. Together, these tools enable efficient data management, real-time insights, and scalable analytics across diverse data scenarios.

## Explanation of Components

The architecture for this lab involves several key components of Microsoft Fabric:

- **Microsoft Fabric Workspace:** The main environment for managing all data-related projects, including resources, permissions, and configuration.
- **Microsoft Fabric Data Factory (or Data Pipelines):** Service for creating, scheduling, and managing data ingestion workflows and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.
- **Microsoft Fabric Data Warehouse (or Synapse Analytics):** Scalable data storage and querying service for performing complex data analysis and running SQL queries.
- **Real-Time Analytics Engine:** Service for processing and analyzing streaming data to provide real-time insights.
- **Microsoft Fabric Notebooks:** Interactive notebooks for developing, training, and testing machine learning models using languages such as Python or R.
- **Apache Spark on Microsoft Fabric:** A distributed computing service for performing large-scale data processing and analytics using Spark clusters.
- **Dataflow Gen2:** A service for designing and executing advanced data transformation workflows, enabling efficient data integration and processing.
